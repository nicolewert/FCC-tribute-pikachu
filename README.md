# FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page [![Website shields.io](https://img.shields.io/website-up-down-green-red/http/shields.io.svg)](http://shields.io/)

An HTML CSS tribute page project I completed for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum.
  
  - The goal of this project was to practice working with externally available images, fonts, and links.
  - In the future I will work to improve the design and add additional pages to the site!
